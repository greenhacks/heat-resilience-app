This is a full-stack create-read-update-delete (CRUD) app dedicated to improving users' thermal comfort and increasing heat resilience.

## MVP 
Users will be able to:

- Create a profile
- Log in and modify their settings (e.g. opt in or out of notifications)
- Receive automated text message alerts based on heat index (function of air temperature and relative humidity)
- Keep track of how many alerts they have received over time on a Dashboard
- Visit About & Resilience Resources pages

## APIs Required
